# dotfiles

## Install
```
curl https://raw.github.com/ilbonte/dotfiles/master/install -L -o - | sh
```

## Inspired by:

https://github.com/filippo-liverani/macform/blob/master/bootstrap nice idea of splitting responsabilities in different repos

https://github.com/christian-fei/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/link for linking all the dotfiles in a folder (they're hidden files so in not _that_ easy)

https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos for the macos stuff

https://dotfiles.github.io/ for everything else
